# Distributed Nodeworks

This project aims to extend the capabilities of
[Nodeworks](https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/nodeworks/) by providing a web
application and framework for executing workflows on distributed hardware, from
high performance computers to Raspberry Pis. The application manages a
collection of task queues that are populated based on the workflow requirements.
End points, or workers, running on distributed hardware will accept, execute,
and publish results from the tasks back to the server so the next highest
priority task in the workflow can be executed.

# Distributed_Nodeworks
### About The Project
Support the development of a distributed workflow (i.e., coordinated execution of multiple tasks performed by different computers) by developing a prototype task management server. This server will accept a diverse range of workflows from an application like Nodeworks ( https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/nodeworks/ ) and manage a collection of task queues that are populated based on the workflow requirements. End points, or workers, running on distributed hardware will accept, execute, and publish results from the tasks back to the server so the next highest priority task in the workflow can be executed.

Recommended prerequisites: Familiarity with intermediate to advanced Python, Git, database server concepts and other tools like Flask. Also some patience & willingness to explore new things.
